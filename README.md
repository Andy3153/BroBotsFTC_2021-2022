## BroBotsFTC_2021-2022

This is the code the team RO142 BroBots uses for the Freight Frenzy season 2021-2022.

In order for all this to work, you need to clone the [FTC Libs](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) first, then clone this repo inside of the folder TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/ in that.
